Hi, everyone! I’m Alex - a current first-year (as of November 2021) and now almost a “graduate” of CHEM 1410! My first semester here has been exciting albeit somewhat challenging, but I’ve learned so much, and I can’t wait to apply my knowledge in future courses! Now onto an overview of CHEM 1410 - you’ll find that CHEM 1410 is structured much differently than typical courses you may have taken in high school. It is very self- and group-driven, and one thing you’ll learn is to work more effectively in independent and small-group settings, where you’ll find you’re spending most of your time. Lectures are driven more towards _reviewing_ content than introducing it for the first time, and on that note, _make sure you understand the textbook reading as completely as possible before you come to lecture_! You’ll find that your independent study is going to have far more use to you before lecture and expos, where you’ll spend a lot of time delving into more specific topics related to what you’ve learned. On that note, expos are some of the best times to reinforce your learning with fellow students, where you’ll get to discuss and debate challenging problems together, all while cumulatively bringing together material from all the previous units. 

To that end, it’s incredibly important to get a good head start on working together with your group and practicing good communication during expos, since failing to do so will certainly come back to bite during the group portion of exams. One thing our group found particularly challenging was managing group work amid a variety of unexpected circumstances, such as a group member contracting coronavirus and other group members getting sick. In these cases, like before, the best solution is _always_ to employ good communication: if you know you’re going to be out of class, let your group members know, and if you don’t see them in class, make sure to reach out and check that they’re doing ok! Oftentimes, your group members might be able to join virtually (over a Zoom meeting, for instance) and contribute to your group’s efforts regardless of their physical presence.

One piece of advice: do _not_ procrastinate, particularly on assignments such as the BIT’s that are cumulative and not submitted until exams! It’s very easy to get behind in independently-driven courses like these, particularly if you have to miss lecture or expo sections because of unforeseen circumstances. It is absolutely crucial that you take care of as many assignments as you can early on, and to be entirely honest, most assignments don’t take any longer than an hour or two at most. I’ve had my fair share of, “oh no! I think I forgot to do my LBLA and it’s due in 30 minutes” moments, and trust me when I say that you do not want to be in that position. That extends to much of what you’ll do throughout college, so generally practicing good time management and being top of your work will do you wonders. Good luck with everything and I hope you’re looking forward to a great experience in CHEM 1410!
