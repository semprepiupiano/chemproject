Something the future chem 1410 students will learn is the importance of engagement in learning. Reading the textbook and watching lectures are one thing, but the level of understanding significantly increases from the direct interaction with concepts in expo. Discussing with others and working through practice problems to test your knowledge makes a huge difference. The students will learn first hand how the best learning is never passive. 

Time management for the group portion of exams was a challenge for our group at first. We were inefficient on the first exam, and ended up staying past the end of class to finish. To solve this problem we made sure to come very prepared for the next exam, each with answers we were confident on and ones we wanted to discuss more. So, we redesigned our test taking strategy, entering all of our confident answers first with simple straightforward reasoning. This meant we could save much more time for the problems we found harder. Once we only had most of the problems out of the way, we could assess how much time was left for discussion, and use that awareness to plan efficiently. 

Make sure to participate! Even when you don't fully understand a concept, ask questions. Never be afraid to participate, because that engagement will end up being extremely beneficial. Collaboration in this class, and throughout your entire life should never be something to shy away from.
